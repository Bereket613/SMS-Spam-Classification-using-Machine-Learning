# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based SMS spam classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed with a Gradio web interface. The model is trained to distinguish between legitimate messages ("ham") and unwanted spam messages.

The goal of this project is to showcase a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment with a user-friendly interface.

## ðŸš€ Features

-   **Deep Learning Model**: A Bidirectional LSTM model for effective text classification.
-   **Advanced Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, stop word removal, lemmatization, and a custom keyword-based feature to improve spam detection accuracy.
-   **Interactive Web UI**: A clean and simple Gradio interface for real-time message classification.
-   **Comprehensive Pipeline**: The code demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline, making it easy to understand and adapt.

This is the gradio interface what a look like in notebook
